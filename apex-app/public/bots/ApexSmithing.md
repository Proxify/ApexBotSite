# ApexSmithing
Efficiently queue smelting & smithing tasks at Artisan's Workshop. Create all items from Base -> Burial and repeat!

**Online Status:**
âœ…(Online) - *Task queue is currently broken, pending Abyss client update

### Features
##### Smelt All Bars & Corrupted Ore
- Excludes Masterwork bars (for now)
- Supports smelting bars directly back into the furnace via Family Crest quest completion
##### Smith all base items and all upgrade levels
- Can be configured to smith from Base -> Burial from scratch or just simply finish off your burial-ready items!
##### Supports Task queueing
- For example, you can configure the bot to smelt 384 Elder Rune Bars and then use those bars to create a full Elder Rune set, all the way from Base to Burial set
- When all tasks are complete, the bot can idle or repeat the queue

### Requirements
- Recommended to use at Artisan's Workshop. The bot can work at other locations, but it is optimized and tested here.
- Smelting Gold or Silver bars requires to completion of Family Crest
