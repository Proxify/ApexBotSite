**Online Status:** 
âœ… (Online)

## Features
##### Supports all Dig Sites and Excavation locations
   * Traverse to all Dig Sites and Excavations via Archaeology Journal or Master Archaeology Outfit
      * Yes... literally all of them! Even includes instanced locations like Warforge's *Thalmund's Forge* and Senntisten's *Colosseum*!
   * Player must have the area unlocked and hotspot discovered for the bot to work as intended
##### Task System
   * Queue multiple excavations across multiple Dig Sites 
       * Tasks can be completed after obtaining a certain Archaeology level, Artefact count or *Material count
          * _*Material count coming soon_
##### Grace of the Elves and Porters
   * Keeps the porter count on your Grace of the Elves topped up. The bank trip will trigger when all porters are gone and porter count within your necklace is depleted
   * Captures Seren Spirits
   * To enable this feature, simply have the porters and Grace of the Elves as a part of your preset
##### Waterfiend Familiar
   * Utilize the Waterfiend to increase your material and artefact gathering rate
   * The bot will refresh the Waterfiend's timer and trigger its special ability when its inventory is full or timer about to expire
##### Special Item Turn-ins
* The bot will automatically Complete Tomes that are granted randomly while excavating
* The bot will automatically turn in Pylon batteries and Skeletal rex fragments
     * Currently disabled feature and will be configured as optional in a future update. These items are currently destroyed prior to a bank trip since they cannot be deposited within the bank
##### Imp-souled Support
   * The bot will automatically drink from Super Restore potions when low on Prayer or Summoning points
##### Soil Box & Upgrades
   * The bot fully supports base-level Soil Box as well as the upgraded versions that can hold more soil
##### Auto-Screener Support
   * Just include the Auto-Screener in your configured preset and the bot will take care of the rest!

## Requirements
##### Client Settings
- Ensure that your RS client settings are set on `Min` and render distance set to `Min`
   - This seems to alleviate some issues users have when attempting to interact with Bank Chests and Material Deposit Boxes
##### Bot Settings
- Player must have a preset configured that contains the items for the corresponding features you'd like the bot to use
   - For example, Waterfiend familiar pouch and scrolls should be in your preset if you want the bot to use the Waterfiend
- Player must have the desired excavation locations unlocked prior to botting at the location
   - Stormguard for instance is a PITA. I'd advise taking the time to unlock all the portals prior to use for a smooth experience
- Player must have the Archaeology Journal or Master Archaeology outfit as part of their preset
- Player must have **five** available inventory slots configured in their preset
- Player must configure their Material Deposit Box to have "Deposit all" option as their single click option
